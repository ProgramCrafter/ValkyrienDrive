```
[V] Establish API for conveniently adding blocks  
[V] Establish API for conveniently adding items  
[V] Make script auto-generating models JSONs or decide this script is not needed  
[ ] Add OC2 to dependencies  
[V] Create stargate controller  
[V] Create block entity for stargate controller  
[*] Implement stargate aligner (like controller and core in WarpDrive)  
[ ] Establish first API version for OC2  
[ ] Implement energy interfaces for IC2 and RF-compatible mods  
[*] Add stargate model from SGCraft  
[ ] Implement deactivating model and stargate if some block is intersecting it  
[ ] Add opened stargate model  
[ ] Implement first version of addressing system  
[ ] Add teleportation behavior to stargate  
[ ] Make multiple stargates in same region not working  
[ ] Add open/close stargate animation  
[ ] Add instability effect damaging all entities on way of pure energy from stargate  

[ ] Create ship controller and aligner  
[ ] Add VS2 to dependencies  
[ ] Create instability effect on ship assembly/disassembly  
[ ] Decide what to do if some ship of medium size cannot fully fit in stargate but tries to teleport  
[ ] Decide how to keep stargate address same(?) when ship assembles or disassembles  
      (pretty easy, because ship construction assumes move to other dimension; stargate could be just forcibly closed)

[ ] Find some more programmers or coders  
[ ] Write remaining parts of TODO  
[V] Find way to make \[ \] look like checkbox and not like square brackets in file on Github
